## DSC Pull Client Supports TLS1.1 and TLS1.2 
Previously, DSC Pull Client only supports SSL3.0 and TLS1.0 over https connections. When forced to use more secure protocols, pull client stops functioning. In this release, DSC Pull Client drops the support of SSL3.0 and add supports for more secure protocols TLS1.1 and TLS1.2.
